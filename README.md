<h6><span style="color:#000000;">Yoga is not a workout, it’s a “work-in.”</span></h6>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">During<span style="color:#000000;"> a regular yoga practice, you will work every system of the body: skeletal, muscular, digestive, circulatory, lymphatic, respiratory, endocrine, reproductive, nervous, reproductive, and cardiovascular. Each yoga class offers a series of asanas (yoga postures) designed to cleanse and detoxify, to compress vital organs and manipulate blood flow to flush out unwanted toxins and to prevent clogging and blockages that can lead to disease.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">What you see on the outside—a lean, strong body—is merely a byproduct of what you get on the inside. Yoga is a virtual fountain of youth, but it’s not a quick fix. It takes work, but the work you put in you get back in dividends.</span>

<h6><span style="color:#000000;">HYQ offers a meaningful movement experience for each student at every season of their life. Whether you are healthy and strong, temporarily injured or managing a special condition, there is a place for you at Hot Yoga Queensbury.</span></h6>

<h6><span style="color:#000000;">Why and How Infrared Works</span></h6>
<span style="color:#000000;">☀Infrared</span><span style="color:#000000;"> heating is simply the transfer of heat from a warm object to a cooler object. The heat is a product of a completely safe spectrum of light that is invisible to our eyes. Just as the sun has been heating people here on earth for thousands of years, our heat panels radiate sun-like warmth to our space, rather than heating the air.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">☀However, unlike the sun, our heating panels do not produce harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Our panels produce sun-like warmth without the dangerous UV radiation that can cause sunburns and skin cancer. Infrared radiation will not pose any sort of health risk to humans and animals.</span>
<h6><span style="color:#000000;">Health benefits </span></h6>
💨Reduces dust/emissions – Unlike forced air heating systems, our infrared radiant heating panels do not blow dust or allergens. They do not release any emissions, chemicals or pollutants and help keep the air clean and clear.
🌡️Therapeutic<span style="color:#000000;"> relief – Odds are you have experienced the soothing feeling of warm summer sun on your skin. Our heaters, like the sun, produce radiant heat waves which work to heat up water. Because the human body is made up of mostly water, this infrared heat transfers extremely effectively and can help gently increase blood circulation, rid the body of toxins and even provide pain relief.</span>[/vc_column_text][/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section indents="none" icon="fal|flame" bg_color="#ffffff" text_color="#333333" tab_id="1552219316074-f5b84053-93f2" title="Benefits of the Heat"][vc_column_text css=".vc_custom_1575279929509{padding-top: 20px !important;padding-right: 20px !important;padding-bottom: 20px !important;padding-left: 20px !important;}"]
<h6><span style="color:#000000;">INCREASE METABOLISM:</span></h6>
<span style="color:#000000;">♥ Your heart rate will increase when activity is done in the heat which creates increased cardiovascular activity and quite simply will cause you to burn more calories quicker. Additionally, the heat increases metabolism levels and speeds up the breakdown of glucose and fatty acids. This helps to tone your body and lose weight. The result is the body will increase the ability to burn fat and increase metabolism.</span>
<h6><span style="color:#000000;">DETOXIFICATION:</span></h6>
🕉️<span style="color:#000000;"> Practicing yoga in a heated room stimulates the lymphatic system responsible for flushing out toxins from your system. This rids your body of harmful substances and makes it healthier. Your capillaries will dilate in the heat oxygenating the tissues, muscles, glands, and organs and helping in the removal of waste products.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">Another method of detoxification is compression. Many yoga postures are specifically designed to compress vital organs and manipulate the blood flow, first to restrict the blood and then to flush it out. This is done through compression—engaging muscles that are located near major organs and then releasing. This also prevents build up and blockages that can lead to fatigue, illness, injury and disease.</span>
<h6><span style="color:#000000;">STRENGTH + FLEXIBILITY</span></h6>
<span style="color:#000000;">→ A common misconception is that you have to be flexible to do yoga. Flexibility is only half of the equation. The goal is to find the perfect balance between strength and flexibility that is necessary for the body to function efficiently. If you are strong, you will become more flexible. If you are flexible, you will become stronger. → The balance of strength and flexibility is key for injury prevention, athletic performance, and maintaining a state of youth and vitality that will allow you to continue an active lifestyle into old age.</span>
<h6>SAFE AND EASY STRETCHING AND OPENING MUSCULOSKELETAL STRUCTURES:</h6>
<h6></h6>
<span style="color:#000000;">While the core temperature of your body may rise no more than a mere 0.5 degree during the course of one of our hot yoga classes, the superficial soft tissue structures, including the fascia, ligaments, muscles, and tendons will warm up quickly and allow you to move further, more comfortably and more safely in all directions than while exercising in a cooler environment. </span>
<span style="color:#000000;">The heat produces a fluid-like stretch allowing for greater range of movement. Your muscles and connective tissue become more elastic and will help you to go deeper into a yoga pose as the body becomes more flexible with less chance of injury. Moreover, the tendons and ligaments are lubricated, thereby increasing your strength, making you tougher and less prone to injury.</span>
<h6><span style="color:#000000;">IMPROVED SPINAL INTEGRITY AND NERVOUS SYSTEM FUNCTION:</span></h6>
<span style="color:#000000;"> By moving the body and thus the spine into all ranges of motion, the student actively opens the vertebrae of the spinal column and strengthens the supportive muscle groups around the spinal column.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">This ensures minimal spinal dysfunction that may result in nerve interference on the pathways between the brain and the body. A healthy spine allows you to enjoy optimal health and well-being. Your nervous system function is greatly improved by opening the joints of the spinal column and messages are carried more efficiently to and from your brain.</span>
<h6><span style="color:#000000;">DEEPER PERFUSION OF BLOOD INTO TISSUES AND ORGANS:</span></h6>
<span style="color:#000000;">The heat thins down the blood and allows it to perfuse deeply into body tissues and organs to facilitate healing. Stretching your muscles in the heat stimulates blood flow to different parts of the body, thereby encouraging circulation of blood and improving the functioning of the circulatory system. Increased blood flow also increases oxygen and nutrient content to different body parts thus invigorating various organs and systems.</span>
<h6><span style="color:#000000;">MENTAL FOCUS AND DISCIPLINE:</span></h6>
<span style="color:#000000;">While the practice may appear to be just physical activity, it is also a form of meditation. The hot environment demands a sharpening of your mental focus, concentration, and determination during class.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">Students notice an absence of distracting thoughts, during the class, as they concentrate on their breath, the posture, their image in the mirror and the guidance of the teacher.</span>
<span style="color:#000000;">Through the discipline of the practice of yoga comes the freedom of the mind. When one develops concentration it leads to meditation. Meditation stills the modifications of the mind.</span>
<blockquote>
<h5>Yoga Sutra 1.2 Yogash chittah vritti nirodhah- Yoga is the cessation of the fluctuations of the mind. One will notice from this practice less reactivity in our daily lives and the ability to be still in action, responding to life’s challenges with clarity.</h5>
</blockquote>
<h6><span style="color:#000000;">MAINTAIN YOUTH + VITALITY</span></h6>
<span style="color:#000000;">As we grow older, gravity takes it’s toll on our bodies. After a lifetime of rounding over—to drive, to work on the computer, to pick things up, our spines begin to shorten. Our bones calcify and become brittle and weak. Through a regular yoga practice, you can maintain the health of your muscles and bones by increasing the flow of synovial fluid, blood, and oxygen to the joints and muscles. This is particularly important of the spine. All yoga postures are centered around lengthening and strengthening the spine. The goal is to create healthy circulation and blood flow to the discs as well as adequate space between them to maintain healthy posture even in old age.
